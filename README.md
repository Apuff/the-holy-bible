Authorized King James Bible

## Description ##

I was not happy with any of the eBook Bibles currently available on Amazon. So I decided to use my God given programming talents to build the best eBook Bible for my Kindle Paperwhite. Here are the important features of this eBook Bible.

* Authorized King James Bible
* Kindle's "Go to Table of Contents" feature includes all books of the Bible including an expandable submenu displaying every chapter of each book.
* Easily search for every verse using the following format: [Book][Chapter].[Verse]
	* ge1.27 => This will find Genesis 1:27
	* he12.1 => This will find Hebrews 12:1
* Each verse only shows the verse number at the beginning of the verse. Other eBook Bibles show the book, chapter, and verse number for their verse search feature. I thought it was too distracting when reading.
* Easily navigate to the next and previous chapter.
* Easily identify what book and chapter you are on while reading.
* "Verse Per Line" format. Every verse is on it's own line and not grouped in paragraphs like in modern Bibles. There is nothing wrong with paragraphs, I just personaly find it easier to memorize scripture in the traditional verse-per-line layout.
* The Table of Contents inside the Bible only displays the 66 books in a clean list. From here you can easily reference each books "shortname". This is useful when searching.

I hope this eBook Bible will be useful for you and that you are continually encouraged by reading the Word of God.

* Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee. - Psalm 119:11
* Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. - Psalm 119:105
