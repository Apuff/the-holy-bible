<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>25</strong></a> Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>26</strong></a> He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>27</strong></a> He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>28</strong></a> And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>29</strong></a> So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>30</strong></a> They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>31</strong></a> The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>32</strong></a> For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>33</strong></a> Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>34</strong></a> When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>36</strong></a> Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>37</strong></a> For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>38</strong></a> But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>40</strong></a> How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>41</strong></a> Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>42</strong></a> They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>44</strong></a> And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>45</strong></a> He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>46</strong></a> He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>47</strong></a> He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>48</strong></a> He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>49</strong></a> He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>50</strong></a> He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>51</strong></a> And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>52</strong></a> But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>53</strong></a> And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>54</strong></a> And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>55</strong></a> He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>56</strong></a> Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>57</strong></a> But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>58</strong></a> For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>59</strong></a> When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>60</strong></a> So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>61</strong></a> And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>62</strong></a> He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>64</strong></a> Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>65</strong></a> Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>66</strong></a> And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>67</strong></a> Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>68</strong></a> But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>69</strong></a> And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>70</strong></a> He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps78.</span>71</strong></a> From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps106.</span>32</strong></a> They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps106.</span>34</strong></a> They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps106.</span>36</strong></a> And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps106.</span>37</strong></a> Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps106.</span>41</strong></a> And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps106.</span>42</strong></a> Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="verse-anchor"><strong><span class="hide-this">Ps106.</span>43</strong></a> Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.</p>
